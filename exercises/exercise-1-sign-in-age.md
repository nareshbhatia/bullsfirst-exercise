# Exercise 1: Sign-In Page

Look at the [visual design](../visual-design). This is a responsive page and should
look good on mobile, tablets and desktop. Make sure that the sign-in form is
centered horizontally and slightly above the center vertically. A good approach
is to distribute one-third of the empty space above and two-thirds below the
form.

- We will use bootstrap and react-bootstrap as our component libraries.
- We will use react-icons to render icons.
- Form handling and validation will be done using react-hook-form and yup.
- The route for this page will be `/`.
- On successful submit, simply console out the form values.

1. bootstrap
2. react-bootstrap
3. react-icons
4. react-hook-form
5. @hookform/resolvers
